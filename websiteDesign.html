          <h4>Brief History</h4>
          <p>I tore my shoulder during my senior season of Division I collegiate golf. I made the most of it and became the assistant coach for my last season. During the Ivy League Championship tournament, the head coach had to leave due to a family event and I assumed the role of head coach for the tournament. Later, during the summer, I needed to get surgery on my shoulder to repair the significant tearing in my labrum. That unfortunately meant that any hopes I had for internship opportunities went out the window since the recovery process was very strict and limited.
            </br>

            Just as I did when I initially injured myself, I made the most of my situation by diversifying my computer language skillset. The majority of my expertise is in C and Java, building projects such as an user-level unix-like operating system and a distributed web crawler and search engine in CIS380 and CIS55 respectively at Penn. To expand my language prowess, I decided to take what I initially learned building the webapp for <a href="varichill.html">Project VariChill</a> and dove into HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I asked on local, online groups and anyone my family knew for opportunities to build websites. I have built and am currently maintaining two websites which are listed below.
